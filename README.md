convert a google maps timeline into a CSV

I'm being audited! They want a list of everywhere I've been in the past year.

Here's my plan:

  1 - get data from Google maps by going to takeout.google.com and selecting location history in JSON format
  2 - run this script to create a CSV.
  
```
  # todo!
```
